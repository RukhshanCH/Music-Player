# 🎵 Music Player Web App – Interactive Front-End Project

I created a fully functional Music Player using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed with a sleek and responsive interface for smooth audio playback.

✨ Key Features:

▶️ Play, Pause, Next, Previous controls

🎶 Playlist support with multiple tracks

📊 Progress bar with draggable seek functionality

⏱️ Display of song title, artist, and duration

🔊 Volume control with mute/unmute option

🔁 Autoplay & repeat features

📱 Responsive design with modern styling and animations

This project demonstrates my ability to combine front-end interactivity, media APIs, and UI/UX design into a practical, engaging web application.
